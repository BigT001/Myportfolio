        About Me
      </h1>
      <p className="text-xl py-2">
       I'm a self-taught full-stack web developer with a passion 
       for creating robust and efficient web applications. My journey 
       into programming was driven by curiosity and desire 
       to learn and improve. <br/><br/>

       Over the years I've cultivated a strong ability to learn 
       quickly and adapt to new technologies. I believe in writing clean, maintainable 
       code and am always looking for ways to optimize performance and improve user 
       experience. <br/><br/>

       I'm passionate about solving complex problems and turning innovative ideas 
       into reality. Whether it's building responsive frontends or developing 
       robust backend systems or optimizing database queries in PostgreSQL, 
       I'm always up for the challenge.
